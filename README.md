# SGNAV
## A collection of tools to help you navigate Singapore's extensive public transport system!

### MRT
station2station helps you navigate from one MRT station to another. It implements Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest way from one station to another.

### Bus
busroutegrab scrapes [MoovitApp's website](https://moovitapp.com/) to get a list of bus routes in Singapore. 
busnodes uses Dijkstra's pathfinding algorithm to find the shortest route from stop to stop. Not tested yet.
